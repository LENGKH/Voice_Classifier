Welcome to the Voice Classifier repository - your go-to Python application for classifying voice recordings using KNN and SVM models. This tool is designed for audio analysis and machine learning experimentation, providing a comprehensive graphical interface for training, evaluating, and classifying audio data based on acoustic descriptors.

## Features

🔹 Classify voice recordings using KNN and SVM models  
🔹 Graphical interface for easy data manipulation  
🔹 Evaluate audio data with acoustic descriptors  
🔹 Designed for machine learning experimentation  

## Repository Topics
