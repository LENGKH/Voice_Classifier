Welcome to the Voice Classifier repository - your go-to Python application for classifying voice recordings using KNN and SVM models. This tool is designed for audio analysis and machine learning experimentation, providing a comprehensive graphical interface for training, evaluating, and classifying audio data based on acoustic descriptors.

## Features

🔹 Classify voice recordings using KNN and SVM models  
🔹 Graphical interface for easy data manipulation  
🔹 Evaluate audio data with acoustic descriptors  
🔹 Designed for machine learning experimentation  

## Repository Topics

['acoustic-features', 'ai', 'artificial-intelligence', 'audio-classification', 'k-nearest-neighbors', 'knn-classifier', 'machine-learning', 'python', 'support-vector-machines', 'svm-classifier']

## Installation
